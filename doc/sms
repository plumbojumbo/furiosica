You can post messages to %%site.name%% using a many kinds of cell
phones that support SMS messaging. This site does not support SMS
directly; rather, it uses your carrier's email gateway to send and
receive messages.

Managing your SMS settings
--------------------------

Use the [SMS settings](%%action.smssettings%%) page to set your SMS
preferences. You can add or change your SMS number and set the
flags for SMS updates.

When you add or change your phone number, you'll receive a message on your
phone with a verification code. Enter it into the SMS settings page to
confirm that the owner of the phone authorizes sending it messages.

Note that only the carriers listed in the drop down list on the form
are supported by %%site.name%%. They're the only ones we know how to
make email addresses for.

Receiving messages
------------------

Once you've verified your phone number, you can enable sending
messages to your phone. If you have a lot of friends and a typical
phone, it can be hard to keep up.

Sending messages
----------------

To send a message, you must send an email to the incoming email
address visible on your SMS settings page. The method for sending
email from your phone varies from carrier to carrier and from handset
to handet; if in doubt, ask your carrier.

Keep your incoming email address a secret -- it's the only way we know
you're really you!
